Enables FAR manager exchanging files with Apple mobile devices.
Requires Apple iTunes installation.

Install latest version of iTunes from Apple.
Unpack zip to FAR Manager's Plugins directory.
Run install.cmd as Administrator (right click on install.cmd and select "Run as Administrator").
This is needed in order to register idevice COM-library.
Restart FAR Manager.
After that, connected iOS devices will appear in FAR Manager's "Disks" menu.

COM library is needed in order to bridge between 64-bit FAR Manager and 32-bit iTunes driver, since Apple never released iTunes driver in 64-bit variant.
32-bit FAR manager users can theoretically merge the two dll's in one.
